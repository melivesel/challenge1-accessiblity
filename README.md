# challenge1-accessiblity

## Description

This was a challenge to modify an existing webpage to increase accessiblity and improve functionality. 
By adding image attributes and semantic elements, the webpage will be more responsive to screen readers and therefore accessible to more people. 
I learned how to add two classes to an element, and improved my skills at formatting images.
